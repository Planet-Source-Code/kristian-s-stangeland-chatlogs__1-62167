WHICH FILES IS NEEDED?

You must download SSubTmr6.dll, TABCTL32.OCX and vbaListView6.ocx to make this 
application work correctly (links at the end of this file), and thereafter
register the files with Setup.bat. Preferably the files (and the bat-file)
should be put in the System/System32-folder within the Windows-folder.

WHY NOT INCLUDE THE FILES IN THE SUBMISSION?

Unfortunately, this isn't allowed according to the rules set by PCC. All submissions
must be free for all EXE, DLL and OCX-files. I could of course rename the files in question
to something else, and then make the BAT-file to rename the files back again, but this would
still be against the rule.
